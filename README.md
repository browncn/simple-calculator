# simple-calculator
This is a simple calculator created on a whim in HTML, bootstrap and javascript and can also be compiled to an android app. Created solely and totally with bootstrap studio. 

Just run the index.html file and you good.

Was hoping to make it a PWA but break was over so moved on to other projects.
